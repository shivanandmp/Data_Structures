// Big O Notation is used to measure the performance of any algorithm by providing the order of growth of the function

// it gives the upper bound on the function by which we can make sure that the function will never grow faster than this upper bound

// We are not interested in exact run time, but in approximate runtime and Big O will give us the same

// BIg O Notation helps in finding the growth rate of the function without plugging in different values of N, 
// and it gives the least upper bound on the function which gives the surity that the function under consideration will never grow faster than this upper bound
// least upper bound simply gives the worst time complexity(best performance) of a function
