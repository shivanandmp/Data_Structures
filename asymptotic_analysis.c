// efficiency os data structure is measured in terms of TIME and SPACE

// An ideal data structure could be the one that takes the least possible time for all its operations and consumes the least possible space

// Our focus will be on finding the TIME COMPLEXITY

// Eg. inserting data at the beginning of the list is way faster in the linked list than arrays

// Running time generally depends on size of the input

// f(n) represents the number of instructions executed for the input value n
// we also have to take care of the growth rate of f(n), a program which is taking less time for small data size may take a large time for a largeer size

// HOW TO FIND THE TIME COMPLEXITY(RUN TIME)

	// 1. Examine the exact running time on a machine
	// 2. Examine the exact running time on different machines
	// 3. Deciding based on the growth rate of a function (Asymptoptic Complexity: the approximate measure of time complexity)
