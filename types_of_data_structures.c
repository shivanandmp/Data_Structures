// 1. Linear Data Structures : elements are arranged in a linear(sequential) order
	// each element here has only one predecessor and one successor(except the first and last element)
	// Eg. arrays, ques, linked lists, stacks


// 2. Non-Linear Data Structures : when all elements are not arranged in a sequential order
	// each elementdoes not have only one predecessor and one successor

// STATIC DATA STRUCTURE: the memory is allocated at compile time. Therefore maximum size is fixed
			// Advantages: fast access
			// DisAdvantages: slower insertion and deletion

// DYNAMIC DATA STRUCTURES: memory is allocated at run time, maximum size is flexible
			// Faster insertion and deletion
			// slower access
